	                    <h2>Em's Story:</h2>
	                    <h4>“You have breast cancer.” In 2009, at just 27 years old, Emily Klaus heard those life-changing words. At the time of her diagnosis Emily was doing what she loved, working at Easter Seals in Tinley Park teaching children with Autism. She was also working towards her Master’s Degree in Special Education. She put her career and education on hold, opting for a double mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Even after taking these most aggressive actions, her cancer came back more than once, and in July of 2012, Emily learned the cancer had metastasized to her brain and spinal column. <br><br>Below is Emily’s narrative of the experiences she had since the cancer metastasized.<br><br></h4>
	                </div>
	                <div class="col-lg-12">
	                    <div class="col-xs-1">
	                    </div>
	                    <div class="col-lg-10">
	                        <p class="lead">I was given whole brain and whole spine radiation for a little over a month. The brain tumor significantly shrunk, making my doctors believe it was just scar tissue showing up on the scans. Some of the spinal tumors shrank, but never died off. I had a really positive attitude with these results. Time and life went on, with three month check-ups and monthly shots. Everything was quiet and stable.<br><br>Then, Christmas of 2014, my scans showed that the spinal tumors were growing and new spots had appeared. My radiation oncologist decided that another round of whole brain and spine radiation was the best next step. The radiation made some improvement, but it wasn't close to the results we had the first time.<br><br>On July 4,2015, I woke up with severe dizziness and nausea. As the day went on, it grew worse. Later that evening we decided I needed to give the ER a visit. My oncologist sent orders for a brain MRI. At 9 PM, as fireworks filled the sky, I laid alone in the MRI machine. Hours later waiting for the results, the ER doctor came in with the news…five new tumors on the brain. Appointments were made to see my oncologist and radiologist to go over next steps.<br><br>Over the next few days, the dizziness stopped, but the blurry eyes started. I couldn't focus unless one eye was covered. The eye doctor said my vision was 20/20, but my eyes weren't able to work together. Now we know one of the brain tumors is on my optic nerve. Because of my depth perception being totally off, I have to resort to using a cane and walker to help with balance and walking. At that moment I lost my independence.<br><br>Since I had two whole body radiations, my oncologist started me on a pill form chemo but took me off of it after one dose. She sent me out to Boston in August of 2015 for a second opinion to make sure her next steps were the same as the doctor at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He agreed, so I headed back to Chicago and started my first round of IV chemo, Gemzar.<br><br>In October of 2015, my sister, who is a nurse, came into my room and said I didn't look good. My blood pressure was really low, I was dehydrated, and had an abnormal heart rate. This was my second trip to the ER, and I learned I was septic with E.Coli in my urine. I was admitted for seven nights. When I was released from the hospital, I took a three week break from chemo before I started up again. About three sessions in, after deciding my body has had enough, I made the most difficult decision to stop chemo and try healing myself with natural treatments and diets. I have a strong feeling and strong belief that these more natural treatments can help boost my own immune system to kill these tumors.<br><br>Unfortunately, I had yet a couple more setbacks. I developed an open wound on my heel that is taking months to close. I've had two grafts put on to help with the healing. So far it's been successful and is almost fully healed.<br><br>The second setback was the urgent removal of my left implant. I was using a heating pad to warm up because I am always cold; I fell asleep with it on my chest leaving a small burn  mark. As days went by, the burn became a blister, then an open wound. My doctor never addressed it nor showed concern. We kept it clean and changed the gauze everyday, but apparently that wasn't enough. The wound got so deep that the skin became red and swollen, suddenly exposing my implant. I had emergency surgery the very next morning for the removal of my implant.<br><br>Although my story sounds brutal, I am trying my hardest to stay strong and positive. And thanks to my family and my amazing friends, I am able to keep a positive outlook on life. I am so grateful for their support and love.</p>
